# World_Happiness_Visualized
In this project I visualize data to identify relationships present in world happiness report data. The data I used for this analysis can be found at: https://data.world/laurel/world-happiness-report-data. This data comes from the world happiness report which contains many variables which document life ladder score, a measure of happiness, other features such as Log GDP, measures of generosity and corpution, and more. Further summaries of the variables in the data can be found here: https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/Appendix1WHR2021C2.pdf. For a detailed look at the investigation I conducted I would reccomend opening up the Data_Visualized.ipynb file in a notebook viewer to see my code and explanations of my findings.
